# jbDetection
really really simple example Jailbreak detection.


# Usage
Add the full fs check if statments (almost the complete code, use both if statments) to all functions in your app. Not just at the start of the function,
just add them randomly in any function. It is way hard to find it in ida or hooper when it is randomly in your other functions. From what i tested, this can not be bypassed with Liberty lite or Liberty lite beta. You can try with other JB detection bypass too, they will likely not work. KernBypass or Vnodebypass should be able to bypass this detection. At least KernBypass is on kernel level.. but if does not hide Cydia and other files for an app, it will not work.
You donÂ´t need to credit me or anything, include this in your app, idc since i wrote this in 2 minutes bc im bored.
